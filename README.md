# learn to redirect! (pretty funny idea)

welcome to my first backend project! this project redirects a url to a different site.

## how to use

1. clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dkoh2018/northwesternrejects.git
   ```
2. navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd northwesternrejects
   ```
3. install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. run the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

happy redirecting! ðŸŽ‰
